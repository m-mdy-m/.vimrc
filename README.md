# vex — My Personal Vim Configuration

![HomePage](./screenshots/home.png)

Welcome to my personal Vim configuration setup! VEX (Vim Ecosystem Extension) is a minimal, Vim setup designed to streamline coding experience. It’s optimized for a clean, dark theme with useful plugins and custom keybindings, making your workflow faster and more intuitive. This configuration is built around my personal needs, but feel free to use or adapt it as you like.

---

## What’s Inside?

- **Plugins**: Handpicked plugins for improved productivity.
- **Settings**: Tweaked Vim settings for optimal coding and editing.
- **Keybindings**: Custom key combinations to save time and reduce effort.

### Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-mdy-m/.vimrc.git && cd .vimrc && ./script/setup  # Let the magic happen!
```

**What the script does**:

1. Checks/installs Vim
2. Links your `.vimrc` to mine
3. Sets up [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
4. Installs plugins automatically
